### LucraClient - Listening for "exit Lucra" 

### Registering `exitLucraHandler` function

To determine when a user has attempted to exit the Lucra experience, you may register a handler function after successful login like so:

```typescript
// Register the exit lucra handler after we are subscribed
lucraClient.exitLucraHandler = () => {
  console.log("User attempted to exit Lucra!");
};
```

An example of where to register this would be in the `loginSuccessHandler` (or after the login event has fired) to ensure the user's Lucra experience is fully ready.
