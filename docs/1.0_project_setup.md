# Getting Started

### Installing the SDK

```
bun install Lucra-Sports/lucra-web-sdk
```

`bun` is shown but installing from Github should be supported by any node package manager you're using

### Typescript

The SDK was developed with Typescript in mind. If you are using Typescript, everything should be typed including the class constructor and the available methods and arguments on the LucraClient class.
