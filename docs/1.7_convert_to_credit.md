# Setting up Convert to Credit

Used when allowing users to withdraw money in credits relevant to your internal system.

#### lucraClient.sendMessage.enableConvertToCredit()

Enables the convert to credit option in the withdraw funds screen. Call this when your application supports credit conversion for withdrawals.

**Example:**

```typescript
lucraClient.sendMessage.enableConvertToCredit();
```

#### lucraClient.sendMessage.convertToCreditResponse(...)

Call this after receiving a `convertToCredit` message when the user attempts to withdraw funds. The user-requested amount to convert will be sent along in the original message:

```
// TypeScript
export type LucraConvertToCreditBody = { amount: number }
```

**Example payload:**

```typescript
lucraClient.sendMessage.convertToCreditResponse({
  id: "xyz-123",
  title: "Game Credits",
  iconUrl: "https://example.com/icon.png",
  conversionTerms: "Instant transfer",
  convertedAmount: "<amount from the convertToCredit message>",
  convertedDisplayAmount: "<desired formatted version of amount>",
  shortDescription: "Convert to game credits",
  longDescription:
    "Withdraw your winnings as game credits that can be used immediately in-game.",
  metaData: {
    ...
  },
});
```
